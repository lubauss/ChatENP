# ChatENP: An Augmented Search Assistant 🤖

ChatENP is a conversational AI application powered by Streamlit 💻, OpenAI 🧠, and Pinecone 🌲. It uses GPT-3.5-turbo for generating responses 💬 and a retrieval-based QA model to search a given knowledge base 📚. The knowledge base is a set of documents uploaded by the user 👤 and the AI uses these documents to answer queries 💭❓.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋
- Python 3.7 or newer 🐍.

### Installation 🔧

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine 💾:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatENP.git
    cd ChatENP
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment ⚙️:**
    ```
    python3 -m venv ChatENP
    source ChatENP/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `ChatENP\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages 📦:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up secrets file 🔑:**

    Create a `.streamlit` directory at the root of your project. Inside the `.streamlit` directory, create a `secrets.toml` file and add your API keys:
    ```toml
    # secrets.toml
    [secrets]
    OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"
    SERPAPI_API_KEY = "your-serpapi-api-key"
    PINECONE_API_KEY = "your-pinecone-api-key"
    PINECONE_API_ENV = "your-pinecone-api-env"
    ```
    Please replace `"your-openai-api-key"`, `"your-serpapi-api-key"`, `"your-pinecone-api-key"`, and `"your-pinecone-api-env"` with your actual keys.

5. **Run the Streamlit app 💫:**
    ```
    streamlit run ChatENP.py
    ```
6. Navigate to the provided local URL in your web browser 🌐.

### Using the App 📲

- **Upload your documents 🗄️:** In the sidebar, you can upload your PDF documents that will be used as the knowledge base for answering queries. Enter a Pinecone namespace and click on "Process⚙️". The app will then extract the text from the uploaded PDFs, create embeddings for the text, and store these embeddings in a Pinecone index.
  
- **Choose a namespace to query 🔍:** In the sidebar, you can select the namespace from which you want to retrieve information. The namespaces correspond to the different document sets you've uploaded.
  
- **Ask a question 💭❓:** In the main panel, enter your question in the text area labeled "Query🔍" and click "Send📤". The app will use the GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a response, querying the document set when necessary.
